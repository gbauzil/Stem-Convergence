    <h2>Do You Know What You Want To Study In College?</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Deciding to pursue a STEM career is a big step and with this there are many options
      as to which career you would like to pursue. </p>
      <br>
    <p>Another important thing to remeber is that with each STEM career, there are many different
    directions, or concentrations, within each major.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Below, I have compiled a list of some of the top STEM jobs. These jobs are not only
    superior in salary, but are also rewarding</p>
  <br>
    <p>and play big roles in other companies.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Mechanical Engineering</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Mechanical engineers work with and design mechanical and thermal devices to find solutions
      to problems using analytics computer design.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Mechanical engineers are also responsible for designing, testing, and analyzing their own products like
    power producing machines and oversee</p>
    <br>
    <p>the manufacturing of that product.This field also has different concentrations when it comes
    what machines that need to bedeveloped.<p>
    <br>
    <p>For example: The performance of cars and their aerodynamics or suspension, heating and cooling, or handling robotics.[1]</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Degrees offered:</b> Bachelor, Masters, Doctoral</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Average Starting Salary:</b> $87,370 [1]</p>
