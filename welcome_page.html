    <h2>Why Should You Pursue A Career In STEM...</h2>
    <img src="stem_stats_1.png" alt="Stats" width="310" height="516" align="right">
    <br></br>
    <p> There are many different possibilities that pursuing a STEM field can provide.
      STEM careers </p>
      <br>
      <p>give high salaries immediately following college graduation which
      can be useful when paying off student debt.</p>
      <br>
      <p>There is a growing rate of opportunities in the STEM fields and it will
      continue to grow as long as </p>
      <br>
      <p>technoogy is continuing to develop. Salaries will increase based off of the
      degree earned. The career </p>
      <br>
      <p>of your choice can be used to make a positive impact on society. Majors such as
      computer science, robotics, and engineering</p>
      <br>
      <p>can lead to the creation of innovative products. STEM majors also have more
      flexibility when it comes to</p>
      <br>
      <p>what you want to do with your STEM degree [1].</p>

      <br>
      <br>

      <h2>Women In STEM...</h2>
      <br>
      <p>Despite the benefits STEM careers may provide, there is an unfortunate gap
        between men and women in these fields.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Fields tht are mostly centered around engineering and technology are male
      dominated making women less likely to pursue a STEM career</p>
      <br>
      <p>Women also earn less in pay than their male counterparts in STEM fields [2]. Women
      of color earn even less degrees in </p>
      <br>
      <p>STEM careers along with asian and latinas. "Women in the US represented 25.5% of
        computer and mathematical occupations" </p>
      <br>
      <p>and "16.2% of architecture and engineering occupations"[2]. There are not many role
      models for women in STEM compared to men.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Mentors that young women can look up to can create an effective learning environment
      that can encourage women to pursue </p>
      <br>
      <p>a certain career path [3]. Aside from the lack of role models, there is also a sexist
      atmosphere within the workplace. This can push</p>
      <!-- <img src="women_stats.jpg" alt="women_stats" width="960" height="684" align="right"> -->
      <br>
      <p>women away from a STEM career. Stereotypes for women are detrimental to the presence
      of more women in the STEM fields. </p>
      <br>
      <p>There is often doubt on whether women are capable of doing the work required for a
      STEM job which can create an unwelcoming </p>
      <br>
      <p>environment.</p>
